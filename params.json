{"name":"(mis)match","tagline":"A Visual Brain Game and iOS App","body":"### Welcome to (mis)match.\r\nWelcome to **(mis)match**, a visual brain game that will change how you think. If you love puzzles, thinking games, or just a good challenge, you’re in the right place.\r\n\r\nEvery image in **(mis)match** is distinguished by three properties such as color, shape and pattern. A “(mis)match” is a group of three images: for each property, the three images must either all match or all differ. You’ll have two minutes to find as many (mis)matches as you can.\r\n\r\nBut watch out! The properties you’re looking for will change on every level. You’ll see properties like size, rotation and even movement.\r\n\r\nEnjoy the challenge!\r\n\r\n[Available on the App Store.](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mismatch-game/id1032809925?ls=1&mt=8)\r\n\r\n### About Us\r\nSusan Stevens is an iOS Developer in Chicago, IL and recent graduate of the University of Chicago's Masters Program in Computer Science.\r\n\r\nSound design for **(mis)match** is by Lincoln Stannard.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
