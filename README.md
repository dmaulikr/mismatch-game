# mismatch-game
Visual Brain Game and iOS App

(mis)match is an visual brain game and iOS app now available for download in the App Store.

Every image in (mis)match is distinguished by three properties such as color, shape and pattern. A “(mis)match” is a group of three images: for each property, the three images must either all match or all differ. The user has two minutes to find as many (mis)matches as she can.

(mis)match uses SpriteKit and interfaces with Game Center.
